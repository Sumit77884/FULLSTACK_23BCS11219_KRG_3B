# MERN Blog Platform (Scaffold)

This is a minimal scaffold for a **MERN** blog platform with:
- User authentication (JWT)
- User profiles (view/edit)
- Blog posts CRUD
- Comments on posts
- Basic route protection and validation

**Structure**
```
backend/    # Express + Mongoose API
frontend/   # React app (CRA-like)
```

This scaffold is intended as a starting point for development, not production-ready.
See backend/README.md and frontend/README.md for run instructions.
